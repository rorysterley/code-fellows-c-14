This repository represents my initial work with web development<br>
and git. As such the directory structure still reflects a manual<br>
system of version controle. Sections of this repo contain folders <br>
for practice as well as documentation for future projects.<br>

<br>Take this repo for what it is: First steps into a new world.

Folders laboled Class# contain submited work for the # class.<br>
The GitExperiments folder is for practice/experimentation prier to submition.<br>
